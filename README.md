# Arabic-dialect-Identification
we aim to provide a framework for understanding the linguistic and cultural diversity of the Arabic-speaking world and to help scholars and researchers analyze and compare these dialects. So we developed a model that takes a text as an input and gives you the name of the dialect as an output.


We used 3 models to get the best results:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes NB
- Support Vector Classification SVC
- Fully Connected Neural network model using the Keras library
